# Deep-Fake-Video-Detection-using-CNN-CNN-LSTM-CNN-GRU
This repository presents the comparative study of three different networks employed for Deep-Fake video detection. 
 
## Frames Extractor
This folder contains code for extracting and saving faces from the video.

## Framing_Testing_reconstructing
This folder contains code for reconstructing the video based on results obtained using Inception v3 model.

## Training
This folder contains code for training and evaluating the models.

## Video Reconstruction
This folder contains code for reconstructing the video based on results obtained using our proposed models viz., CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU.

## framing and face generation for datasets
This folder contains code for extracting and saving faces from the video. In addition to this it does splitting i.e. saving face dataset in the form of 3 different folders training, testing and validation.

### Video_Deepfake_Detection_Using_CNN,_LSTM,_GRU.ipynb
This ipynb contains code for testing and reconstruting the video using all 3 models.
